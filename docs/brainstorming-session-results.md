**Date:** 2025-08-08
**Facilitator:** Mary (Business Analyst)
**Participant:** Charles (Founder/Developer)

## Session Context

### Initial Situation
- **Background:** Non-developer building an app to solve workplace problems in NDIS service provision
- **Key Assets:** 
  - caddy.team domain (2 years paid via Cloudflare)
  - Google Workspace for emails
  - GitHub organization
- **Primary Constraint:** Must be as cost-free as possible for MVP
- **Critical Challenge:** RBAC and authentication implementation
- **Previous Experience:** Used Clerk (found it hit-and-miss)

### Session Goals
1. Learn industry-standard steps for organized app development
2. Solve RBAC/authentication pain points effectively
3. Create actionable development roadmap for non-developer founder
4. Minimize costs while maintaining professional standards

## Brainstorming Progress

### Approach Selection
*Awaiting selection from 4 options:*
1. Guided Discovery Session
2. Problem-First Mapping (Recommended)
3. Learn-by-Example Approach
4. Progressive Complexity Flow

### Key Questions Raised
- What specifically made Clerk "hit and miss"?
- How many user types exist in the NDIS workplace?
- What's the most complex permission scenario needed?

---

## Ideas Generated

### Problem-First Mapping: RBAC & Authentication

#### Pain Points Identified
1. **Environment Management Complexity**
   - Struggled with Clerk's local/staging/production setup
   - Dashboard configuration was difficult
   - Need simpler deployment pipeline

2. **Cost-Conscious Architecture**
   - Must avoid Clerk's paid tier for MVP
   - Need to sync users to database without premium features
   - Looking for free/low-cost alternatives

3. **Complex Permission Requirements**
   - 5 user roles: Platform Admin, Org Admin, Finance, Support Coordinator, Support Worker
   - Group-based access for support workers
   - Hierarchical document/note sharing
   - Cross-visibility of shift notes between support workers

#### Authentication Alternatives Explored

**Supabase Auth** (Recommended)
- Pros: 50k free MAU, built-in PostgreSQL, Row Level Security
- Cons: Vendor lock-in, learning curve for RLS
- Perfect for: Cost-conscious MVP with complex permissions

**Lucia Auth**
- Pros: Complete control, free forever, educational value
- Cons: More setup time, security responsibility
- Perfect for: Founders who want deep understanding

**Clerk (Optimized)**
- Pros: Already familiar, excellent DX
- Cons: Sync complexity, cost scaling concerns
- Workaround: Use webhooks for free tier sync

#### Key Questions Raised
- What's the biggest authentication fear?
- Can support workers belong to multiple groups?
- Can participants have multiple coordinators?
- Who controls worker-participant assignments?
- What data should finance role access?

### Requirements Clarification

#### User Insights Captured
1. **Biggest Fear**: B) Setting it up wrong and rebuilding later + D) Not implementing needed permissions
2. **Decision**: Stick with Clerk despite challenges
3. **Support Worker Groups**: Can belong to multiple groups for team messaging
4. **Coordinator Coverage**: Need delegation when coordinator on leave
5. **Assignment Control**: Both admins and coordinators can assign
6. **Finance Access**: Participant data, claims, timesheets, employee docs

#### Edge Cases Discovered
- **Coordinator Leave Coverage**: Critical requirement for temporary access delegation
- **Group Messaging**: Need to message all support workers for specific participant
- **Finance Dual Role**: Often overlaps with admin functions

### Solution Architecture

#### Clerk Integration Strategy (Free Tier)
```
Clerk (Authentication) → Webhook → Your Database (Permissions)
```

**Database Tables Needed:**
1. **users** - Synced from Clerk with role
2. **groups** - Support worker groupings  
3. **user_groups** - Many-to-many relationships
4. **participant_access** - Who can access which participants
5. **delegation_log** - Temporary coordinator coverage

#### Permission Model
- **Role-Based**: 5 core roles (Platform Admin, Org Admin, Finance, Coordinator, Support Worker)
- **Group-Based**: Support workers organized in overlapping groups
- **Delegation-Based**: Temporary access for coverage
- **Audit Trail**: Track all access for compliance

#### Development Roadmap
**Week 1: Foundation**
- Next.js + TypeScript setup
- Clerk integration (single environment)
- PostgreSQL database
- User sync webhooks

**Week 2: Core Permissions**
- Role definitions in code
- Permission middleware
- Group management
- Scenario testing

**Week 3: Advanced Features**
- Coordinator delegation
- Group messaging
- Document access control
- Audit logging

### Additional Requirements Discovered

#### External Provider Layer
- Participants work with external providers (physios, OTs, psychologists)
- Need to track external organizations for budgeting
- External providers linked to NDIS budget categories
- May need limited system access in future

#### Refined Permission Requirements
- **Team-Based Access**: More natural than delegation
- **Support Worker Isolation**: Can ONLY see assigned participants
- **Finance Approval Rights**: Can approve/reject timesheets
- **Note Deletion**: Soft delete required per NDIS regulations
- **Audit Trail**: Mandatory for all data access

#### NDIS Compliance Requirements
- 7-year data retention
- Soft deletes only (no hard deletes)
- Incident reports immutable
- Progress notes amendable with history
- Version tracking for all changes

### Technical Architecture Decisions

#### Database Schema Evolution
```
Core Entities:
- users (Clerk sync)
- teams (coordinator groups)
- participants
- external_providers
- external_organizations

Permission System:
- participant_access (who can see what)
- role_permissions (what each role can do)
- audit_log (who did what when)

Compliance Layer:
- soft_deletes (deleted_at timestamps)
- version_history (all changes tracked)
- immutable_records (incident reports)
```

#### File Structure for Non-Developer
```
/app
  /auth (Clerk integration)
  /dashboard
    /admin (permission management)
    /coordinator (participant management)
    /finance (claims/approvals)
    /support-worker (notes/shifts)
  /api
    /webhooks (Clerk sync)
    /permissions (all auth checks)
/lib
  /permissions (business logic)
  /audit (compliance logging)
```

### Development Strategy Options

**Option 1: Full Implementation (4-5 weeks)**
- Complete permission system
- External provider management
- Full audit trail
- Admin UI for daily changes

**Option 2: MVP with Growth Path (3 weeks)**
- Core permissions only
- Manual external provider tracking
- Basic audit logging
- Add complexity as needed

**Option 3: Hybrid Approach**
- Buy/adapt existing solution
- Customize for NDIS needs
- 2 weeks but higher cost

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Research NDIS Quality & Safeguards Commission data requirements
2. Document soft delete and versioning requirements
3. Create permission matrix spreadsheet
4. Design admin UI wireframes
5. Set up development environment with Clerk

### Week-by-Week Plan
**Week 0: Legal & Compliance Research**
**Week 1: Core Infrastructure Setup**
**Week 2: Permission Engine Development**
**Week 3: Admin UI Implementation**
**Week 4: Testing & Refinement**

### Open Questions
- Should external providers have system access? ✅ RESOLVED: Track only, no access
- What's the acceptable timeline vs complexity tradeoff?
- Need legal review of data retention policies?
- Integration with existing NDIS systems required?

### External Provider Clarification
- **External providers**: Tracked entities only (no system access)
- **Structure**: Provider → Organization relationship
- **Data sharing**: PDF export capability for note sharing
- **Example**: John Doe (physio) → Sample Organization
