# Project Brief: Caddy - NDIS Service Provider Management Platform

## Executive Summary

The Caddy platform is a comprehensive NDIS service provider management system that streamlines participant care coordination, plan management, and regulatory compliance for disability support organizations. The platform addresses the critical challenge of managing complex NDIS requirements while maintaining efficient service delivery by providing integrated tools for participant profiles, real-time plan budget tracking, service bookings, automated NDIS claiming, and intelligent compliance management. With mobile-first design for support workers and self-service portals for participants, Caddy targets the full spectrum of NDIS service providers—from support coordinators and plan managers to large disability support organizations. By automating workflows, providing real-time budget visibility, and ensuring seamless NDIS portal integration, Caddy reduces administrative burden by up to 60% while maintaining 100% compliance accuracy through built-in NDIS business rules and automated documentation.

## Problem Statement

NDIS service providers currently face a perfect storm of operational challenges that threaten both service quality and financial viability. Providers manage an average of 50-200 participants, each with unique plans, funding categories, and support needs, while navigating constantly evolving NDIS pricing arrangements and compliance requirements. The current state relies on a patchwork of disconnected systems—Excel spreadsheets for budget tracking, paper-based documentation, manual rostering systems, and separate billing software—leading to an average of 3-4 hours of administrative work per participant per month.

The impact is substantial: providers report spending 40% of their operational time on administration rather than participant care, with common issues including missed claiming deadlines resulting in $50K-200K annual revenue loss, compliance breaches averaging $20K in penalties, staff burnout from repetitive manual tasks with 35% annual turnover, and participants experiencing service gaps due to poor coordination. A recent NDIS Commission report found that 67% of providers struggle with maintaining compliant documentation, while 78% cite administrative burden as their primary operational challenge.

Existing solutions fall short because generic practice management software lacks NDIS-specific features and business rules, requiring extensive workarounds. Purpose-built NDIS platforms are often prohibitively expensive ($500-2000/month), overly complex with 3-6 month implementation periods, or focused on single aspects (just rostering or just billing) rather than end-to-end workflow. Most critically, current solutions fail to address the interconnected nature of NDIS operations where participant data, service delivery, documentation, and billing must work in perfect synchronization.

The urgency is escalating with the NDIS Commission increasing audit frequency by 300% this year, new quality and safeguarding standards requiring digital evidence trails, participant expectations for transparency and self-service growing rapidly, and competitive pressure as efficient providers gain market share while others struggle with manual processes. Without a comprehensive solution, providers risk becoming non-viable as margins compress and compliance requirements expand.

## Proposed Solution

Caddy provides NDIS service providers with a streamlined web platform that solves the critical pain points of budget tracking and compliance documentation. The system maintains accurate participant profiles imported from NDIS plans, tracks service delivery against budget categories in real-time, and generates compliant documentation and claims ready for NDIS portal submission. 

The platform succeeds through radical simplicity—every feature directly prevents revenue loss or compliance breaches. Providers can see exactly how much funding remains in each category, support workers can quickly log service delivery with compliant notes, and administrators can generate bulk claims with confidence. No complex setup, no lengthy training, just immediate value.

By focusing exclusively on the money-and-compliance loop, Caddy can launch in 3 months rather than 12, prove value with real providers, and fund expansion through revenue rather than speculation. Future versions will add intelligence, integrations, and mobile apps—but only after proving the core value proposition with a working product that providers actually use and pay for.

## Target Users

### Primary User Segment: Small to Medium NDIS Service Providers

**Profile:** Independent providers and small organizations with 20-100 participants, typically 5-20 staff members, operating in metro and regional areas. Annual revenue between $500K-$5M, often founder-led or family businesses that started from direct care experience. Decision makers are typically owner-operators (45%), operations managers (35%), or admin managers (20%) who oversee 3-5 coordinators and 10-15 support workers.

**Current Behaviors:** Using combination of Excel, paper forms, and WhatsApp for coordination. Manual NDIS portal claims submission taking 2-3 days per fortnight. Storing documents in shared drives or filing cabinets. Owners wearing multiple hats—CEO, support coordinator, and administrator. Peak system usage occurs 7-9am (shift starts), 3-5pm (shift ends), and 7-9pm (admin catch-up), primarily on desktop for administration tasks.

**Specific Pain Points:** Spending nights and weekends on administration (20-25 hours/week). Missing claim deadlines causing $3,000-8,000/month revenue leakage. Struggling to scale beyond 50 participants due to admin overhead. Cannot afford enterprise solutions or dedicated admin staff. Fear of compliance audits due to inconsistent documentation. Managing 45-60 day payment cycles requiring $50K-150K working capital.

**Goals:** Reduce admin time to focus on participant care. Ensure no revenue leakage from missed claims. Build confidence in compliance readiness. Scale operations without proportional admin cost increase. Maintain personal touch while growing efficiently. Achieve ROI within 3 months on any new system investment ($200-500/month price point).

### Secondary User Segment: Support Workers and Coordinators

**Profile:** Frontline staff delivering direct participant support, ages 22-55, varying tech literacy levels. Mix of casual (40%), full-time (30%), and veteran workers (30%). Often working across multiple providers. High turnover rate (30-40% annually). Support coordinators managing 20-60 participants each, constantly context-switching between cases.

**Current Behaviors:** Recording notes on paper or phones during shifts. Texting photos of timesheets to office. Calling coordinators for plan/budget questions. Struggling to access participant information in the field. Veterans know NDIS well but frustrated by repetitive tasks, while casuals need foolproof simple tools with zero training time.

**Specific Pain Points:** Duplicate data entry (paper to digital). No visibility of participant budgets or approved services. Unclear documentation requirements. Time spent on admin not billable. Difficulty tracking hours across multiple providers. Fear of compliance mistakes leading to job loss. Feeling isolated in field work without team connection.

**Goals:** Quick, simple shift documentation (under 2 minutes per shift). Clear understanding of service boundaries. Spend more time with participants, less on paperwork. Get paid accurately and on time. Feel confident they're meeting compliance requirements. Have professional growth opportunities beyond hourly work.

### MVP Success Criteria

The MVP is successful when a provider can complete the full cycle: import participant plans, log services daily with 70% less data entry via smart defaults, track budgets in real-time with traffic light warnings, view their daily operations in one huddle screen, and generate error-free claims with revenue prediction—all within the same time it previously took just to prepare claims. Providers should experience immediate value in the form of visibility ("I can finally see where we stand"), efficiency ("It practically fills itself in"), and confidence ("I know we're compliant and not missing revenue"). The system must handle 50 participants and 20 staff users without performance degradation, process a full fortnight's claims in under 5 minutes, and maintain data integrity with zero corruption or loss events. The gamified compliance score should drive 30% improvement in documentation completeness within first month.

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints

- **Budget:** Bootstrap/self-funded initially with <$50K available capital. No external funding for first 12 months. Revenue must fund growth after MVP. Development team of 1-2 people maximum.
- **Timeline:** 3-month MVP development window. 6 months to positive cash flow requirement. 18 months to break-even target. Must launch before end-of-financial-year NDIS rush (June).
- **Resources:** Single technical founder/developer initially. Part-time design and QA support only. No dedicated sales or support staff for 6 months. Limited marketing budget ($500/month maximum).
- **Technical:** No access to official NDIS APIs initially. Must work within existing CSV import/export paradigm. Convex free tier limits (suitable for MVP): 125M database reads/month, 25M writes/month, 100GB bandwidth. Australian data residency achievable via Convex edge regions. Healthcare data compliance requirements. Limited to web-based solution initially (no native apps). Convex production tier ($25/month) easily handles 50+ organizations.

### Key Assumptions

- NDIS service providers are actively seeking digital solutions and willing to change workflows for efficiency gains
- Small-medium providers (20-100 participants) represent an underserved market with budget for SaaS solutions
- CSV-based integration is acceptable as an MVP approach given current provider workflows
- Word-of-mouth will be primary growth driver in tight-knit provider community
- Providers will trust a new platform with sensitive participant data if security is demonstrated
- 25% efficiency improvement is achievable and valuable enough to justify $200-500/month pricing
- Support workers with varying technical skills can adopt a well-designed web interface
- NDIS pricing and compliance requirements will remain relatively stable for next 12 months
- Competition will not release similar focused solution in next 6 months
- Single geographic market (Sydney/NSW and ACT) is large enough for initial traction
- Providers will participate in beta testing in exchange for discounted pricing
- Technical architecture can scale from 5 to 50 customers without major refactoring
- Part-time support model is viable with good documentation and self-service
- Bootstrap approach can compete with VC-funded competitors through focus and efficiency

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

- **Competition from Established Players:** Lumary or ShiftCare could release a simplified SME product that eliminates our market opportunity. They have brand recognition, existing relationships, and deeper pockets. Mitigation: Move fast, focus on specific pain points they ignore, build strong customer relationships.

- **NDIS Policy Changes:** Major changes to NDIS pricing, claiming processes, or compliance requirements could invalidate our solution. The NDIS review in 2024 may restructure the entire system. Mitigation: Build flexible architecture, maintain close contact with NDIS updates, design for adaptability.

- **Data Breach or Security Incident:** A single security breach could destroy trust and trigger regulatory penalties. Healthcare data is a prime target for attackers. Bootstrap budget limits security infrastructure. Mitigation: Security-first development, regular audits, cyber insurance, transparent incident response plan.

- **Slow Adoption/Market Education:** Providers may be more resistant to change than assumed. Getting past "we've always done it this way" could take longer than projected. Mitigation: Strong onboarding, video tutorials, success stories, gradual migration path.

- **Technical Debt Accumulation:** Pressure to ship quickly could create unmaintainable code. Scaling issues could emerge earlier than expected. Single developer creates knowledge risk. Mitigation: Document everything, automated testing from day 1, regular refactoring sprints.

- **Cash Flow Crunch:** 6-month runway with slow initial sales could force premature decisions. Customer acquisition costs might exceed projections. Mitigation: Aggressive beta discounts, annual prepayment incentives, consulting services for revenue.

### Open Questions

- What is the exact process for becoming an NDIS registered software provider, and is it required?
- How do providers currently handle inter-organization participant transfers?
- What percentage of providers would pay annually upfront for a discount?
- Are there specific peak usage times we should plan infrastructure scaling around?
- What integration with myplace portal is possible without official API access?
- How do we handle participants who work with multiple providers simultaneously?
- What level of customer support do competitors actually provide?
- Can we legally store de-identified data for analytics and benchmarking?
- What happens when a participant's plan is retroactively changed by NDIA?
- How do we price for providers with multiple trading entities/ABNs?

### Areas Needing Further Research
