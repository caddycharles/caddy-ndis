# 003 - Use Clerk for Authentication

**Date:** 2025-08-09  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Deciders:** Winston (Architect), Charles (Founder)  

## Context
We need a secure, compliant authentication solution that supports multi-factor authentication, session management, and role-based access control. As a bootstrap startup, we need to avoid building authentication from scratch to focus on core business features.

## Decision
We will use Clerk as our authentication provider for user management, authentication, and authorization.

## Consequences
### Positive
- Production-ready authentication out of the box
- Built-in MFA support
- User management UI included
- SOC 2 Type II compliant
- Excellent Next.js integration
- Reduces development time significantly
- Handles password resets, email verification
- Session management included

### Negative
- Monthly costs ($25/month + usage)
- Vendor lock-in
- Limited customization of auth flows
- Dependency on third-party service
- Data residency considerations

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Auth0**
   - Rejected: More expensive, complex for our needs
   
2. **Supabase Auth**
   - Rejected: Requires Supabase database
   
3. **NextAuth.js**
   - Rejected: More development work required
   
4. **Custom JWT implementation**
   - Rejected: Security risks, compliance concerns, time investment
