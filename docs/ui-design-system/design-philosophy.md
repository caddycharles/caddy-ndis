# ðŸŽ¨ Design Philosophy

Caddy's design system balances **professionalism** with **approachability**, creating an interface that healthcare workers trust while ensuring it remains delightful to use. We prioritize clarity, accessibility, and efficiency - remembering our users are often on mobile devices, in the field, with limited time.

## Core Principles

1. **Trust Through Consistency** - Every interaction should feel familiar and reliable
2. **Progressive Disclosure** - Show only what's needed, when it's needed
3. **Delightful Micro-interactions** - Small animations and feedback that make the app feel alive
4. **Mobile-First, Always** - Design for thumbs on phones first, then scale up
5. **Accessibility is Non-negotiable** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum
