# Design Principles

## 1. Speed Over Features
Every interaction optimized for completion speed. If it takes more than 3 clicks, redesign it.

## 2. Visual Hierarchy
Critical information (budgets at risk, missing documentation) always visible and prominent.

## 3. Progressive Disclosure
Show only what's needed for the current task. Advanced options available but hidden.

## 4. Consistent Patterns
Same actions work the same way everywhere. Learn once, apply everywhere.

## 5. Forgiving Design
Undo capabilities, confirmation for destructive actions, and graceful error recovery.

## 6. Accessible by Default
WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, high contrast options.
