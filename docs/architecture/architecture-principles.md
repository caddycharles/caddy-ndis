# Architecture Principles

## 1. User Experience First
Every architectural decision evaluated against user impact. Performance budgets enforced.

## 2. Progressive Complexity
Start simple, add complexity only when proven necessary. Monolith first, microservices later.

## 3. Data Integrity Above All
Financial and compliance data must be accurate. Prefer consistency over availability.

## 4. Security by Design
Defense in depth, zero-trust networking, encryption everywhere, principle of least privilege.

## 5. Cost-Conscious Engineering
Optimize for operational efficiency. Use managed services where sensible.

## 6. Developer Experience Matters
Fast builds, hot reloading, comprehensive testing, clear documentation.

## 7. Mobile-First Performance
Optimize for support workers on phones with poor connectivity.

## 8. Compliance as Code
Automate NDIS compliance requirements into the architecture.
