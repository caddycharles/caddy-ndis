# Executive Summary

Caddy's architecture is designed as a modern, cloud-native, multi-tenant SaaS platform optimized for rapid deployment, operational efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. The system follows a modular monolith approach with Next.js 14, enabling fast initial development while maintaining the flexibility to extract services as needed for scale.

## Key Architectural Decisions

- **Modular Monolith**: Start simple, scale smart - avoid microservices complexity initially
- **Next.js Full-Stack**: Single framework for frontend and backend, reducing complexity
- **PostgreSQL + Redis**: Proven data stack with read replicas and caching
- **Railway Platform**: Modern PaaS for simplified operations and automatic scaling
- **Edge-First**: CDN and edge functions for global performance
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works on 3G, scales to 5G

## Architecture Goals

1. **3-Minute Tasks**: Every user flow optimized for speed
2. **Zero Downtime**: Blue-green deployments with instant rollback
3. **Sub-2s Page Loads**: Edge caching and optimized bundles
4. **99.9% Uptime**: Redundancy at every layer
5. **NDIS Compliance**: 7-year retention, audit trails, soft deletes
