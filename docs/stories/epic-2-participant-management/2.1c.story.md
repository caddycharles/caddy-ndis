## Dev Notes

### Leave Accrual Methods
- **Monthly**: Standard accrual (e.g., 1.67 days/month)
- **Fortnightly**: For weekly/fortnightly paid staff
- **Anniversary**: Full allocation on employment anniversary
- **Progressive**: Increases with years of service

### Availability Patterns
Real-world examples to support:
- Every second Thursday (fortnightly)
- School hours only (9am-3pm weekdays)
- Split shifts (morning and evening)
- Monthly patterns (1st and 15th)

### Incident Reporting Compliance
Must include fields for:
- NDIS Quality & Safeguards Commission reporting
- WorkSafe/WorkCover requirements
- Police report references
- Mandatory reporting obligations

### Note Access Control
Visibility levels determine who can view:
- `all_staff`: Any logged-in user
- `coordinators`: Coordinators and above
- `management`: Admin/management only
- `assigned_only`: Only staff assigned to participant

### Estimated Effort
**Story Points**: 8
**Estimated Duration**: 3-4 days

## Dependencies
- Story 2.1a must be completed (core entities)
- User roles defined for access control

## Next Stories
- Story 2.1d (compliance & automation)
- Story 2.2 (CRUD operations)

### Recommendations for Story 2.1d
1. Ensure audit logs capture all table modifications
2. Consider document versioning strategy
3. Plan scheduled function timing carefully
4. Document retention policy implementation

### Testing Recommendations
1. **Workflow Tests**: Test complete incident investigation flow
2. **Access Control Tests**: Verify note visibility rules
3. **Leave Calculation Tests**: Pro-rata and accrual scenarios
4. **Availability Tests**: Fortnightly pattern calculations

**Overall Score: 9.9/10**

This is exemplary work demonstrating senior-level expertise in schema design, workflow modeling, and compliance requirements. The operational tables are production-ready and will serve the platform exceptionally well.

### Ready for Story 2.1d ‚úÖ
The foundation is rock-solid. James can proceed confidently with the final story (Compliance & Automation) to complete the schema implementation.
