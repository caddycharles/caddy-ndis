## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Epic 1 completed with full infrastructure setup including:
- TanStack Start initialized
- Clerk authentication integrated
- Convex project connected
- Development environment running

### Schema Design Principles
- Normalized structure to prevent duplication
- Use Convex's built-in _id for references
- Email as human-readable identifier (no employee IDs)
- Flexible relationship tables for many-to-many connections

### Technical Specifications
- Use Convex validators (v) for all fields
- All tables get automatic _id and _creationTime
- Use v.id() for foreign key references
- Dates stored as ISO strings
- Money amounts in cents (integer)

### NDIS Number Validation
- Format: 9-10 digit string
- Stored as string to preserve leading zeros
- Example: "430000000" or "4300000001"

### Estimated Effort
**Story Points**: 5
**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 days

## Dependencies
- Epic 1 stories completed ‚úÖ
- Convex project initialized ‚úÖ

## Next Stories
- Story 2.1b depends on this schema foundation
- Story 2.2 (CRUD operations) depends on this schema

## Change Log
| Date | Version | Description | Author |
|------|---------|-------------|--------|
| 2025-01-13 | 1.0 | Story created from 2.1 split | Sarah (Product Owner) |

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent: James (Full Stack Developer)
**Model Used**: claude-opus-4-1-20250805
**Date**: 2025-01-13

### Implementation Summary
Successfully implemented all 6 core entity tables for Story 2.1a:
1. **organizations** - Tenant management with subscription tracking
2. **users** - Staff with Clerk auth, roles, and qualifications
3. **participants** - NDIS participants with comprehensive profile fields
4. **addresses** - Normalized addresses for polymorphic entities
5. **emergencyContacts** - Priority-ordered contacts with authority flags
6. **participantAssignments** - Many-to-many worker-participant relationships

### Key Design Decisions
- Used single `convex/schema.ts` file with clear section comments for organization
- Implemented polymorphic relationships for addresses and emergency contacts using entityType/entityId pattern
- All dates stored as ISO strings for consistency
- Money amounts will be stored as integers (cents) to avoid floating point issues
- No manual employee IDs - using email and Clerk ID as identifiers
- Comprehensive indexes for common query patterns
- Search index on participants for fast lookup

### Technical Details
- All tables include required validation using Convex validators
- Foreign key relationships use `v.id()` for type safety
- Indexes optimized for common access patterns
- Optional fields properly marked for flexibility
- Enums used for status fields and fixed value sets

### Files Modified
- `convex/schema.ts` - Complete rewrite with 6 core tables
- `convex/users.ts` - Fixed internal mutation declarations for webhooks

### Testing Results
- ‚úÖ Schema compiles successfully with `npx convex dev`
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation passes with no errors
- ‚úÖ All tables created in Convex dashboard
- ‚úÖ Type generation working correctly

### Debug Log
- Fixed TypeScript errors in `convex/users.ts` by changing webhook mutations to `internalMutation`
- Schema compilation successful on first attempt
- All indexes created without issues

### Completion Notes
- Story 2.1a fully implemented and tested
- Ready for Story 2.1b (NDIS-Specific Tables)
- Foundation in place for remaining schema stories

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-13
**Reviewer**: Quinn (Senior Developer & QA Architect)
**Review Type**: Code Quality & Architecture Review

### ‚úÖ Implementation Quality: EXCELLENT

#### Strengths
1. **Schema Architecture**: Well-structured with clear separation of concerns
2. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive use of Convex validators ensuring runtime type safety
3. **Documentation**: Excellent inline documentation explaining each field's purpose
4. **Index Strategy**: Thoughtful indexing for common query patterns
5. **Data Normalization**: Proper normalization with polymorphic relationships for addresses/contacts
6. **NDIS Compliance**: All required fields present with appropriate validation

#### Code Quality Observations

**Architecture & Design (9/10)**
- ‚úÖ Clean separation between entities and relationships
- ‚úÖ Polymorphic pattern for addresses and emergency contacts well implemented
- ‚úÖ Foreign key relationships properly typed with `v.id()`
- ‚úÖ Search index on participants for efficient lookups
- üîç Minor: Consider extracting enum types to constants for reusability

**Data Validation (9/10)**
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive field validation using Convex validators
- ‚úÖ Required vs optional fields properly designated
- ‚úÖ NDIS number stored as string (correct for preserving leading zeros)
- ‚úÖ Dates consistently stored as ISO strings
- üîç Enhancement: Could add regex validation for NDIS numbers (9-10 digits)

**Performance Considerations (10/10)**
- ‚úÖ Excellent index coverage for all common access patterns
- ‚úÖ Compound indexes for multi-field queries
- ‚úÖ Search index on participants table
- ‚úÖ No over-indexing detected

**Maintainability (9/10)**
- ‚úÖ Clear code organization with section comments
- ‚úÖ Consistent naming conventions
- ‚úÖ Well-documented field purposes
- üîç Suggestion: Consider type aliases for commonly repeated patterns

#### Minor Issues Found

1. **ESLint Configuration**: Project needs migration to ESLint v9 config format
   - Impact: Low - Not blocking functionality
   - Recommendation: Update in separate housekeeping task

2. **TODO Comments in users.ts**: Webhook handlers still have placeholder implementations
   - Impact: Medium - Will need implementation for user CRUD
   - Recommendation: Address in Story 2.2 (CRUD operations)

#### Security Considerations
- ‚úÖ Sensitive data fields properly marked as optional
- ‚úÖ No hardcoded values or credentials
- ‚úÖ Clerk integration properly structured
- ‚úÖ Organization isolation built into schema design

#### Testing Recommendations
1. **Unit Tests**: Create tests for schema validation rules
2. **Integration Tests**: Test foreign key relationships
3. **Performance Tests**: Validate index effectiveness with sample data
4. **Security Tests**: Verify organization data isolation

### Verdict: APPROVED ‚úÖ

The implementation exceeds expectations with excellent architecture, comprehensive validation, and thoughtful index design. The schema provides a solid foundation for the NDIS support coordination platform.

**Risk Assessment**: LOW
- Schema is production-ready
- Minor improvements can be addressed in future iterations
- No blocking issues identified

### Recommendations for Next Steps
1. Proceed with Story 2.1b (NDIS-Specific Tables)
2. Address ESLint configuration in a housekeeping task
3. Implement actual CRUD operations in Story 2.2
4. Consider creating schema validation helper functions

**Overall Score: 9.5/10**

Excellent work by the development team. The schema demonstrates senior-level thinking with proper normalization, type safety, and performance optimization.
