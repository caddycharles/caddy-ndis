## Dev Notes

### NDIS Support Categories
Full structure as per NDIS Price Guide:
- **Core Supports**: 4 categories
- **Capacity Building**: 7 categories  
- **Capital Supports**: 2 categories

Each category has specific item numbers and rates that will be referenced in services.

### Plan Management Types
- **Self-Managed**: Participant manages own funding
- **Plan-Managed**: Plan manager handles funding
- **NDIA-Managed**: NDIA manages funding
- **Combination**: Mix of above

### Dependencies on Story 2.1a
Requires these tables from 2.1a:
- participants (foreign key)
- users (for support workers)
- organizations (for claims)

### Monetary Values
All amounts stored in cents (integer) to avoid floating point issues:
- $100.00 = 10000
- $50.50 = 5050

### Estimated Effort
**Story Points**: 5
**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 days

## Dependencies
- Story 2.1a must be completed first
- Core entity tables must exist

## Next Stories
- Story 2.1c can proceed in parallel
- Story 2.2 (CRUD operations) depends on this

4. Document NDIS category mappings for frontend development

**Overall Score: 9.8/10**

Outstanding implementation that exceeds expectations. The developer has demonstrated deep understanding of both NDIS requirements and database design best practices. This is senior-level work.
