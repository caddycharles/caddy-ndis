# Story 1.1: Project Initialization

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** Developer  
**I want** to set up the TanStack Start project with Convex  
**So that** we have a working development environment  

## Acceptance Criteria
1. TanStack Start project initialized with TypeScript
2. Convex project created and connected
3. Vite configured for optimal development
4. Environment variables properly configured
5. Git repository initialized with proper .gitignore

## Tasks / Subtasks

    - node_modules/
    - .env.local
    - .convex/
    - dist/
    - .vite/
  - [x] Make initial commit with project setup
  
- [x] Verify development environment (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [x] Run `npm run dev` to start TanStack Start dev server
  - [x] Run `npx convex dev` in separate terminal for Convex
  - [x] Verify app loads at localhost:5173
  - [x] Verify Convex connection in browser console
  
- [x] Add initial project documentation
  - [x] Update README.md with setup instructions
  - [x] Document required environment variables
  - [x] Add development workflow notes
  
- [x] Final verification checklist
  - [x] `npm run dev` starts without errors
  - [x] Convex dashboard shows active development deployment
  - [x] TypeScript compilation passes with no errors
  - [x] Browser loads app at localhost:5173 successfully

## Dev Notes

### Technology Stack Context
**[Source: docs/architecture/technology-stack.md]**

The project uses TanStack Start as the frontend framework with Convex as the complete backend platform. This combination provides:
- File-based routing with end-to-end type safety via TanStack Start
- Vite-based build system for fast development
- Convex reactive database with real-time subscriptions built-in
- No separate backend infrastructure needed

### Frontend Stack Details
**[Source: docs/architecture/fullstack-architecture.md#frontend-architecture]**
- Framework: TanStack Start (not Next.js)
- Language: TypeScript 5.x with strict mode
- Build Tool: Vite (integrated with TanStack Start)
- Testing: Vitest + Playwright (to be configured in later stories)

### Project Structure
**[Source: docs/architecture/fullstack-architecture.md#project-structure]**

The initialized project should follow this structure:
```
src/
├── routes/                 # TanStack Start routes
│   ├── __root.tsx         # Root layout with providers
│   └── index.tsx          # Home page (will become Dashboard)
├── components/
│   ├── ui/                # Shadcn components (Story 1.3)
│   ├── features/          # Feature-specific components
│   └── layouts/           # Layout components
├── convex/                # Backend functions
│   ├── _generated/        # Auto-generated by Convex
│   └── schema.ts         # Database schema (Story 2.1)
├── lib/
│   ├── hooks/            # Custom React hooks
│   ├── utils/            # Utility functions
│   └── validators/       # Zod schemas
├── stores/               # Zustand stores for UI state
└── styles/
    └── globals.css      # Global styles
```

### Convex Integration
**[Source: docs/architecture/technology-stack.md#backend-stack]**
- Convex provides the complete backend platform
- No PostgreSQL, Prisma, or Redis needed (supersedes old ADRs)
- Real-time subscriptions and offline support built-in
- File storage with CDN included in Convex platform

### Environment Configuration
**[Source: docs/adr/004-tanstack-convex-platform.md]**
Required environment variables:
- `CONVEX_URL`: Deployment URL from Convex dashboard
- `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: (To be added in Story 1.2)
- `VITE_` prefix for any client-side environment variables

### Development Workflow
**[Source: docs/architecture/fullstack-architecture.md#cicd-pipeline]**
- Frontend runs on localhost:5173 (Vite dev server)
- Convex dev deployment for backend
- Hot module replacement enabled
- Type-safe end-to-end development

### Important Architecture Decision
**[Source: docs/adr/004-tanstack-convex-platform.md#decision]**
This project is being rebuilt from scratch using TanStack Start + Convex, superseding the original Next.js 14 + PostgreSQL stack. This decision was made for:
- Radical simplicity with single backend platform
- Real-time by default with automatic syncing
- Zero DevOps overhead
- Better offline support

**Note:** This is a greenfield implementation - no migration from previous codebase required.

### Testing Standards
**[Source: docs/architecture/fullstack-architecture.md#testing-strategy]**
- Unit tests will use Vitest with React Testing Library
- Integration tests will use Convex test client
- E2E tests will use Playwright
- Coverage target: 80%
- Test configuration will be set up in a later story

### Package Version Recommendations
For consistency across the team, consider using these versions (update as needed):
- TanStack Start: Use latest stable version at time of implementation
- Convex: Use latest stable CLI version
- TypeScript: 5.x or later
- Document exact versions in package.json after selection
