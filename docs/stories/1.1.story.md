## Dev Notes

### Technology Stack Context
**[Source: docs/architecture/technology-stack.md]**

The project uses TanStack Start as the frontend framework with Convex as the complete backend platform. This combination provides:
- File-based routing with end-to-end type safety via TanStack Start
- Vite-based build system for fast development
- Convex reactive database with real-time subscriptions built-in
- No separate backend infrastructure needed

### Frontend Stack Details
**[Source: docs/architecture/fullstack-architecture.md#frontend-architecture]**
- Framework: TanStack Start (not Next.js)
- Language: TypeScript 5.x with strict mode
- Build Tool: Vite (integrated with TanStack Start)
- Testing: Vitest + Playwright (to be configured in later stories)

### Project Structure
**[Source: docs/architecture/fullstack-architecture.md#project-structure]**

The initialized project should follow this structure:
```
src/
├── routes/                 # TanStack Start routes
│   ├── __root.tsx         # Root layout with providers
│   └── index.tsx          # Home page (will become Dashboard)
├── components/
│   ├── ui/                # Shadcn components (Story 1.3)
│   ├── features/          # Feature-specific components
│   └── layouts/           # Layout components
├── convex/                # Backend functions
│   ├── _generated/        # Auto-generated by Convex
│   └── schema.ts         # Database schema (Story 2.1)
├── lib/
│   ├── hooks/            # Custom React hooks
│   ├── utils/            # Utility functions
│   └── validators/       # Zod schemas
├── stores/               # Zustand stores for UI state
└── styles/
    └── globals.css      # Global styles
```

### Convex Integration
**[Source: docs/architecture/technology-stack.md#backend-stack]**
- Convex provides the complete backend platform
- No PostgreSQL, Prisma, or Redis needed (supersedes old ADRs)
- Real-time subscriptions and offline support built-in
- File storage with CDN included in Convex platform

### Environment Configuration
**[Source: docs/adr/004-tanstack-convex-platform.md]**
Required environment variables:
- `CONVEX_URL`: Deployment URL from Convex dashboard
- `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: (To be added in Story 1.2)
- `VITE_` prefix for any client-side environment variables

### Development Workflow
**[Source: docs/architecture/fullstack-architecture.md#cicd-pipeline]**
- Frontend runs on localhost:5173 (Vite dev server)
- Convex dev deployment for backend
- Hot module replacement enabled
- Type-safe end-to-end development

### Important Architecture Decision
**[Source: docs/adr/004-tanstack-convex-platform.md#decision]**
This project is being rebuilt from scratch using TanStack Start + Convex, superseding the original Next.js 14 + PostgreSQL stack. This decision was made for:
- Radical simplicity with single backend platform
- Real-time by default with automatic syncing
- Zero DevOps overhead
- Better offline support

**Note:** This is a greenfield implementation - no migration from previous codebase required.

### Testing Standards
**[Source: docs/architecture/fullstack-architecture.md#testing-strategy]**
- Unit tests will use Vitest with React Testing Library
- Integration tests will use Convex test client
- E2E tests will use Playwright
- Coverage target: 80%
- Test configuration will be set up in a later story

### Package Version Recommendations
For consistency across the team, consider using these versions (update as needed):
- TanStack Start: Use latest stable version at time of implementation
- Convex: Use latest stable CLI version
- TypeScript: 5.x or later
- Document exact versions in package.json after selection

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-13
**Reviewer**: Quinn (Senior Developer & QA Architect)
**Status**: APPROVED WITH MINOR OBSERVATIONS

### Code Review Summary

#### ✅ Acceptance Criteria Verification
1. **TanStack Start with TypeScript** - ✅ Confirmed: Project properly initialized with TypeScript 5.7.2
2. **Convex Integration** - ✅ Partial: Basic setup complete, full deployment pending interactive terminal
3. **Vite Configuration** - ✅ Confirmed: Vite 6.3.5 configured, dev server running on port 5173
4. **Environment Variables** - ✅ Confirmed: .env.local created with proper placeholders
5. **Git Repository** - ✅ Confirmed: Repository initialized with comprehensive .gitignore

#### ✅ Strengths
- **TypeScript Configuration**: Excellent strict mode setup with proper path aliases
- **Project Structure**: Clean initial structure following TanStack Start conventions
- **Documentation**: Well-written README.md with clear setup instructions
- **Git Configuration**: Comprehensive .gitignore covering all necessary files
- **Code Quality Tools**: ESLint and Prettier properly installed

#### ⚠️ Minor Issues (Non-blocking)

1. **ESLint Configuration**: Using deprecated .eslintrc.json format
   - ESLint v9 requires migration to flat config format (eslint.config.js)
   - Current setup will work but shows deprecation warnings
   - Recommendation: Address in future technical debt story

2. **Code Formatting**: Source files not formatted with Prettier
   - 9 files need formatting (demo files from template)
   - Non-critical as these are demo files to be removed
   - Recommendation: Run `npm run format` before next story

3. **Convex Full Setup**: Placeholder configuration only
   - James correctly noted the limitation with non-interactive terminals
   - Full Convex deployment URL not yet available
   - Acceptable given technical constraints

#### ✅ Testing Results
- `npm run typecheck` - ✅ Passes without errors
- `npm run dev` - ✅ Server starts successfully on port 5173
- Application loads - ✅ Verified at http://localhost:5173
- `npm run lint` - ⚠️ Works but shows config deprecation warning
- `npm run format:check` - ⚠️ Demo files need formatting

#### Architecture Compliance
- ✅ Follows TanStack Start + Convex architecture from ADR-004
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode enforced
- ✅ Correct port configuration (5173)
- ✅ Proper separation of concerns with convex/ directory

#### Security Review
- ✅ .env.local properly excluded from git
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets found
- ✅ Secure defaults in configuration

### Recommendations for Next Stories
1. Complete Convex deployment when interactive terminal available
2. Consider ESLint flat config migration in technical debt backlog
3. Format all source files before Story 1.2 implementation
4. Remove demo files after Story 1.3 when UI foundation is complete

### Final Verdict
**APPROVED** - Story 1.1 successfully establishes the project foundation. All critical acceptance criteria met. Minor issues are non-blocking and can be addressed in future iterations. James did excellent work adapting to the Convex setup limitations.
