# Housekeeping Setup - Complete ✅

**Date**: 2025-01-13
**Initiated by**: Product Owner (Sarah)
**Purpose**: Establish development standards for lean, maintainable code

## What We've Implemented

### 1. Development Standards Document (`CONTRIBUTING.md`)
- ✅ Single source of truth principle (no duplicate files)
- ✅ Clear folder organization structure
- ✅ Import hygiene rules (path aliases)
- ✅ Code deletion over commenting
- ✅ Testing co-location
- ✅ Refactoring protocols

### 2. AI Assistant Guidelines (`CLAUDE.md`)
- ✅ Specific instructions for AI assistants
- ✅ References CONTRIBUTING.md rules
- ✅ Quick decision trees
- ✅ File organization reference
- ✅ Clear DO and DON'T lists

### 3. Automated Enforcement (Pre-commit Hooks)
- ✅ **Husky** installed for git hooks management
- ✅ **lint-staged** configured for staged file processing
- ✅ Automatic formatting with Prettier
- ✅ TypeScript compilation checking
- ✅ Import organization

### 4. IDE Configuration (`.vscode/settings.json`)
- ✅ Format on save enabled
- ✅ Auto-organize imports on save
- ✅ ESLint auto-fix on save
- ✅ Generated files excluded from search
- ✅ TypeScript path resolution configured

### 5. Additional Configurations
- ✅ `.editorconfig` for cross-editor consistency
- ✅ `.lintstagedrc.json` for pre-commit rules
- ✅ Updated `.gitignore` with comprehensive exclusions

## How It Works

### On Every Commit:
1. Husky triggers pre-commit hook
2. lint-staged runs on staged files:
   - Prettier formats code
   - TypeScript checks for errors
   - Files are cleaned up
3. Commit proceeds if all checks pass

### On Every Save (VSCode):
1. Prettier formats the file
2. Imports are organized
3. ESLint issues are fixed

### For New Contributors:
1. Run `npm install` - automatically sets up hooks
2. Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` for standards
3. Read `CLAUDE.md` if using AI assistance
4. Start coding - tools handle formatting

## Key Benefits Achieved

1. **No More Duplicate Files** - Clear rule against ComponentV2, etc.
2. **Consistent Structure** - Everyone knows where files belong
3. **Automatic Formatting** - No "formatting" commits needed
4. **Type Safety** - Can't commit broken TypeScript
5. **Clean Imports** - Automatic organization and path aliases
6. **AI-Friendly** - Clear instructions for AI assistants

## Metrics for Success

We should see:
- ✅ Zero duplicate/versioned files
- ✅ All files in correct folders
- ✅ Consistent code formatting
- ✅ No commented-out code blocks
- ✅ Clean import statements
- ✅ Passing TypeScript compilation

## Future Considerations

For technical debt backlog:
- Migrate ESLint to v9 flat config format
- Add commit message linting (conventional commits)
- Consider adding test coverage requirements
- Set up automatic dependency updates

## Team Action Items

1. All team members should pull latest and run `npm install`
2. Review `CONTRIBUTING.md` before next sprint
3. Configure IDE to use project settings
4. Report any issues with hooks to team lead
