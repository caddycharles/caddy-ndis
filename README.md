# Caddy - NDIS Support Coordination Platform

A modern, real-time platform for NDIS support coordination, built with TanStack Start and Convex.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: TanStack Start (React) with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Convex (real-time database and serverless functions)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI (to be configured)
- **Authentication**: Clerk (to be configured)
- **Build Tool**: Vite

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.x or later
- npm 10.x or later

### Development Setup

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**:
   - Copy `.env.local` and add your keys
   - Add your Convex deployment URL (obtained when running Convex dev)
   - Add Clerk keys (will be configured in Story 1.2)

3. **Start the development servers**:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Start the frontend
   npm run dev

   # Terminal 2: Start Convex backend (when fully configured)
   npx convex dev
   ```

4. **Access the application**:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:5173
   - Convex Dashboard: Access via terminal output when running convex dev

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server on port 5173
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm run format:check` - Check code formatting
- `npm run typecheck` - Check TypeScript types
- `npm run test` - Run tests with Vitest

## Development Workflow

1. Stories are tracked in `docs/stories/`
2. Each story contains detailed requirements and acceptance criteria
3. Follow the story implementation checklist in each story file
4. All features are implemented based on approved user stories

## Environment Variables

Required environment variables in `.env.local`:

```bash
# Convex deployment URL
CONVEX_URL=your_convex_deployment_url

# Clerk authentication (Story 1.2)
CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_key
```

## Code Quality

This project enforces code quality through:
- TypeScript strict mode
- ESLint for code linting
- Prettier for code formatting
- Git hooks for pre-commit checks (to be configured)

## Contributing

This project follows a story-driven development approach. All features are implemented based on approved user stories in the `docs/stories/` directory.
